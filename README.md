> A code sample used to facilitate discussion

A CLI tool to update Epicor IDs in Lake Street.

## Usage

## Notes to candidate

- The code is functional and runs, there's no requirement to run the code if you don't want to.
- You have 20 mins to conduct your review, looking for mistakes or things that could be done better. Hint: there's a wide range of things to look for.
- **You are the reviewer, feel free to ask questions about the code during the discussion**
- You are reviewing code that is for intended for production
- If you have listed "Python" on your resume, you're on the hook for the "Pythonic" issues in the code

**This is a discussion about an app that's already written, not a programming exercise.** :smiley:
